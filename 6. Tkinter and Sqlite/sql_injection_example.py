    # Notice how we had to change age into an integer to
    # make sure that it was a valid age, but then we had
    # to change it back into a string in order to concatenate
    # it with the rest of the line; this is because we created
    # the line by adding a bunch of strings together, including
    # using single quotation marks to denote strings within our string.



# If youâ€™re still not clear how this works, try inserting a person into
# the table, then print (line) to see how the full line of SQL code looks.
