# Basic Python Projects

#### These are two basic Python Projects I created, which use various modules, such as Tkinter, SQLite3, pip, and more.

## Projects:

- Phonebook
- Check Files GUI


### Phonebook
#### This project works as a phone book for a user, allowing them to save contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database. It also gives the user the option to update and delete previously stored entries.

### Check Files GUI
#### This GUI allows the user the ability to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory, or folder, to another and save those files in a database.
