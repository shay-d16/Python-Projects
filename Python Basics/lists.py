# This is a set of challenges regarding lists in Python
# given to me by The Tech Academy.


### 1. Create a list.
myList = ["Gon", "Killua", "Kurapika", "Leorio", "Hisoka"]


### 2. Loop through the list with a for loop.
for i in myList:
    print(i)


### 3. Use the append() method.
myList.append("Knuckle")
print(myList)



### 4. Make a copy of the list. Example: List method copy().
x = myList.copy()
print(x)



### 5. Concatenate two lists
secondList = ["Morel","Chrollo","Neferpitou","Kite","Biscuit"]
print(myList + secondList)


### 6. Use the reverse() method on a list
myList.reverse
print(myList)
